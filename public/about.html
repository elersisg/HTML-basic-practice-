<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a Second year undergraduate student from the Instituto TÃ©cnologico de Santo Domingo, 
  excited to be part of the work environment and learn more about the software engineering industry 
  before beginning my stage as a fully prepared professional graduate. I am a responsible and organized person, 
  who with the necessary knowledge, can carry out any assignment that requires it.
